  <h2> What is a VDC? </h2>
  The Virtual Data Container (shortly refered to as "VDC") represents a new way of presenting the data. As the modern world constantly evolves, data are becoming a really valuable asset. During the past decade, the total amount of data generated by the world has skyrocketed. It seems only reasonable to move on to new ways of handling data, but also presenting / selling them as products. What if we were able to choose among various services, applications that suit our needs, simply presented and easily organised inside a  virtual container? What if, choosing the best apps and services was just as simple as choosing a product from the Super Market? The Virtual Data Container aims to become exactly that. A new way of presenting data, services and applications, as mentioned earlier.

  In a few words, a Virtual Data Container could be a set of data, a web service, an operating system, an application etc., organised in a virtual container image and presented to the potential buyers / users. This is the future, transforming existing operations and datasets to services and making them easily accesible to the end users. A VDC is versatile, easily upgradable, and can be tailored to a specific customers' needs. However, in case a VDC is structured as a concrete and preset / prefixed service, potential users can find out if a its good for them or not.

As data can be distributed among resources both on the Cloud and the Edge, Virtual Data Containers (the VDCs) are proposed as a mean for timely and securely offering data also transparently with respect to their location and format.
In more detail, a VDC:
- Provides uniform access to data sources regardless of where they run, i.e., on the edge or on the cloud.
- Embeds a set of data processing techniques able to transform data (e.g., encryption, compression).
- Allows composing these processing techniques in pipelines (inspired by the node-RED programming model) and executing the resulting application.
- Can be easily deployed on resources which can live either on the edge or in the cloud.
