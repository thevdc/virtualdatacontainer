## Welcome to Virtual Data Container's Official Page

Here you will have all the access to the VDC's code, the Blueprint Editor's code, as well as their latest releases.

### What is a VDC?
The Virtual Data Container (shortly refered to as "VDC") represents a new way of presenting the data. As the modern world constantly evolves, data are becoming a really valuable asset. During the past decade, the total amount of data generated by the world has skyrocketed. It seems only reasonable to move on to new ways of handling data, but also presenting / selling them as products. What if we were able to choose among various services, applications that suit our needs, simply presented and easily organised inside a  virtual container? What if, choosing the best apps and services was just as simple as choosing a product from the Super Market? The Virtual Data Container aims to become exactly that. A new way of presenting data, services and applications, as mentioned earlier.

In a few words, a Virtual Data Container could be a set of data, a web service, an operating system, an application etc., organised in a virtual container image and presented to the potential buyers / users. This is the future, transforming existing operations and datasets to services and making them easily accesible to the end users. A VDC is versatile, easily upgradable, and can be tailored to a specific customers' needs. However, in case a VDC is structured as a concrete and preset / prefixed service, potential users can find out if a its good for them or not.

### How can I know which VDC best suits my needs?
For a VDC's operation to be fully understandable by potential users / buyers, each and every one will have a unique JSON formatted document, named "Blueprint". This Blueprint is divided into four main sections. Each section refers to a specific group of people, for each group to better understand the VDC's structure and way of operation. The first section is intended to provide general information to one of the company’s decision strategy makers, usually the one responsible for it’s vision. The second one should provide all the information needed for a company’s executive who has primary responsibility for managing it’s finances and all the issues of financial nature. The third section should refer to the company’s executive whose main, primary focus is on scientific and technological issues within the organization. Last but not least, the fourth section should be written with the company’s developers in mind. They shall have access to all the vital information for their knowledge upon the VDC to be thorough.
