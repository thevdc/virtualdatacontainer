### What is a VDC?
Virtual Data Container (shortly refered to as VDC) represents a new way of presenting the data. As the modern world constantly evolves, data are becoming a really valuable asset. During the past decade, the total amount of data generated by the world has skyrocketed. It seems only reasonable to move on to new ways of handling data, but also presenting / selling them as products. What if we were able to choose among various services, applications that suit our needs, simply presented and easily organised inside a  virtual container? What if, choosing the best apps and services was just as simple as choosing a product from the Super Market? The Virtual Data Container aims to become exactly that. A new way of presenting data, services and applications, as mentioned earlier.
